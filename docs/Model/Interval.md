## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**close** | **string** | The close value is actually the time that the store closes. Local time (in Military format) is used. So, if a store closed at 8 PM local time, the close time would look like the following: 20:00:00. This field is conditionally required if the intervals container is used to specify working hours or special hours for a store. This field is returned if set for the store location. | [optional]
**open** | **string** | The open value is actually the time that the store opens. Local time (in Military format) is used. So, if a store opens at 9 AM local time, the close time would look like the following: 09:00:00. This field is conditionally required if the intervals container is used to specify working hours or special hours for a store. This field is returned if set for the store location. | [optional]
