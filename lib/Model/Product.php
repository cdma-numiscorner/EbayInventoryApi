 * @description This type is used to define the product details, such as a title, a product description, product aspects/item specifics, and links to images for the product. Optionally, in a createOrReplaceInventoryItem call, a seller can pass in an eBay Product Identifier (ePID) or a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) value, such as an EAN, an ISBN, a UPC, to identify a product to be matched with a product in the eBay Catalog. The information in this type is also returned in the getInventoryItem, getInventoryItems, and bulkGetInventoryItem calls if defined.
