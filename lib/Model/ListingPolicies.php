Every published offer must have a payment, return, and fulfillment listing policy associated with it. This type is also used to override the shipping costs of one or more shipping service options that are associated with the fulfillment policy, to enable eBay Plus eligibility for a listing, or to enable the Best Offer feature on the listing.
